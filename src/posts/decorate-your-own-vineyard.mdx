## How it all started

There is a interesting question, how many pages should be written for your resume? It's funny that I delivered a resume with twelve pages when I first took an interviewüòÇ. And as time goes on, more and more projects and vulns I hope to show to public. You can't put a palace on ten white pages, so I planed to build a new blog and portfolio site.

## Fork from

The template is forked from [HamishMW's Personal portfolio](https://github.com/HamishMW/portfolio) .

Thanks for [Hamish Williams](https://hamishw.com/)! üòä

## Monogram

Source code path: src/components/Monogram/Monogram.js

It's a SVGPathElement.

### design and paint online

I use a online svg editor, [boxy svg](https://boxy-svg.com/), to design and paint a monogram (RX) for myself, RonnyX.

Hah, here is the sketch in my mind.üòÅ

This is my "manuscript":

<img src="/static/monogram-rx-layout.svg" alt="monogram" height="300" />

It's also paint by the boxy-svg. But I have a small problem, how do I use the path to draw concentric circles for filling? Sorry for the stupid question, it's my first time to design a logo.

Remove any extra auxiliary lines, ha thats it.

Then I used the GIMP to export the svg path and resize the picture, convert the format.
